The Challenge

To refactor an exisitring webpage to make it accesible for all users and and to optimize the serach engines.

User Story:

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


Acceptance Criteria for the Webpage:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The Process:
Understand what the webpage does.
Research sources to understand how to accomplish the task
    -What is code refactoring
    -HTML semantics
    -CSS style and consolidation
    -Proper READ.me file and description
Apply the concepts above to the final project and show the changes using commit and psuedo code.
